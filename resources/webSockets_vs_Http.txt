websockets
- connection is kept OPEN
- bi-directional communication
- socket ===> combination of ipAddress + port

websockets used @
- some examples
    realtime apps, game applications
    chat apps
- we wont make a httpRequest / API call to fetch data every now & then
    it'll be time consuming - to make api call & fetch data
    we have to open connection, client/server acknowledgements - handshakes & stuff
    But if we use websockets

How web sockets work
- the connection remains open
- ipAddress + port @ client side <========> ipAddress + port @ server side
- both are connected and communicate every 25 seconds (ping-pong)
- so, any messaging will be instantly fast compared to http
