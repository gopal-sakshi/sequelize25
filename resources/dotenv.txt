Environment variables 
- variables external to our application 
- they reside in the OS or the container of the app is running in.
- they are used for decoupling application configurations
- some examples are
    HTTP Port & Address
    Database connection information
    Location of static files/folders
    Endpoints - For dev your app will point to a test API URL, whereas in prod it points to live API URL.
    Sensitive data like API keys 
------------------------------------------------------------------
Generally, public dont use "dotenv" in production
they use "dotenv" only in dev, qa, staging etc

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
    require('dotenv').config();
}
------------------------------------------------------------------
Why
- In production, you set the environment variables directly into your 
    virtual machine (or) docker container (or) dedicated server
- you might not have ssh access to them
- plus, you can't push .env file to your version control
    as you should never push credentials to git
------------------------------------------------------------------

config will read your envi file
- assign the properties to process.env
- store the result in "parsed" property
- see db.js
