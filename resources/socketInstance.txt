emitting & listening events
broadcasting events
joining & leaving rooms
------------------------------------------------------------

Socket.id
- each new connection is assigned a random 20-characters identifier.
- Upon creation, the Socket joins the room identified by its own id
    which means you can use it for private messaging:


Socket.handshake
{
    headers:        /* the headers of the initial request */
    query:          /* the query params of the initial request */
    auth:           /* the authentication payload */
    time:           /* the date of creation (as string) */
    issued:         /* the date of creation (unix timestamp) */
    url:            /* the request URL string */
    address:        /* the ip of the client */
    xdomain:        /* whether the connection is cross-domain */
    secure:         /* whether the connection is secure */
}


Socket#rooms
- reference to the rooms the Socket is currently in.


Additional attributes
- you can attach any attribute to the Socket instance and use it later:
- socket.user23 = user23;


Socket middlewares
- these middlewares are called for each incoming packet:
