default namespace that socketIO clients connect to ===> '/'
it is identified by io.sockets (or) io
using 'io.sockets' is equivalent to using 'io' only

io.on listens to the server events. 
connection is an event on the server, when a socket is connected

socket.on listens to events on that connected socket. 
socket.on('textMessage') asks to do something 
    when textMessage event is emitted on the socket
    which you do from your client using socket.emit('textMessage')
