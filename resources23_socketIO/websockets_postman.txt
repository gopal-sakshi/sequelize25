you cant save socketIO requests in a collection that already has httpRequests
Raw/websocket protocol is different to Socket.io protocol
choose socket.io protocol for making websocket requests

In socketIO request
- any data/message is sent as default event name "messages"
- but, you can give your custom event name - "greet23"
